## Intro

The Swiss confederation provides a large amount of data spanning virtually
every aspect of the political process in Switzerland. With a convenient API
to query the proceedings of committees, councillors, parties, logs of voting sessions ...

From this massive resource we decided to study voting patterns in the Swiss
government.


## Main contribution

Our insight was that voting patterns can be considered as a recommender
system : the user-item interaction matrix is a politician-vote interaction
matrix.

The attractiveness of this method is that we get some insights "for free".
The matrix completion setting allows for vote prediction : we can guess how
likely a politician is to vote yes/no on an issue given his voting record and
the voting record of his peers.
In the matrix factorisation setting we compute a latent space representation
of the politicians and the votes : these factors can represent some higher level
characteristics, embedded within the observations. We can compute similarities
or correlations in these higher dimensional spaces to get insight on the voting
patterns.
